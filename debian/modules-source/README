LIRC kernel modules source for DEBIAN
=====================================

By default, debian/rules will set the kernel-specific options from the          
kernel source tree in /usr/src/linux.                                           

You need to have a complete linux source tree for your kernel, not just an      
up-to-date kernel image, to compile the LIRC drivers.  The LIRC modules         
contain some references to kernel source files.

To recompile the LIRC kernel modules:

     If you are using make-kpkg:

     0)   Make sure you have installed kernel-package.

     1)   Unpack /usr/src/lirc-modules.tar.gz into your working directory.
          !!WARNING!!
          If you use same working directory where an old version of the source
          is put, then you remove the old source before extracting this new
          source.

     2)   Go to the the base of the kernel source tree (usually the
	  /usr/src/linux directory).
     
     3)   To build the LIRC modules, execute:
               make-kpkg --revision number modules_image

          where number is the same revision number used to build the
          kernel-image package in the previous step. This will generate a
          lirc-modules-<kernel version> deb file in the parent directory.

          MODULE_LOC environment variable specifies a top directory
          where kernel module sources you want to build are put.
          For example, if you want to build LIRC and the source
          are put in ~/modules/lirc/, then you need to
          set MODULE_LOC="~/modules".

          All settings can be set in /etc/lirc/lirc-modules-source.conf or
          via debconf (debconf is preferred):

	  	dpkg-reconfigure lirc-modules-source

     4)   Install the newly created deb file (you can use `dpkg -i file').

     If you are not using make-kpkg:

     If your kernel is compiled with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS enabled, for kernel
     symbol version checking, /usr/include/linux/modversions.h (the symbol
     version database) will be required. This is created by running `make dep'
     (in addition to `make config) in the kernel source tree.

     1)   Ensure that the kernel source tree is in the /usr/src/linux
          directory and ensure that it is configured (execute `make config
          dep' in the /usr/src/linux directory).

     2)   Go to the lirc root directory.

     3)   Execute as root (or fakeroot) `debian/rules binary-modules'. This
          will generate an lirc-modules-<kernel version> deb file in the
          parent directory.

          You must manually set KDREV environment variable, which specifies
          the Debian kernel revision on which this LIRC modules package
          depends. For example, if the Debian revision of the kernel package
          is Custom.1, the proper command would be
               debian/rules KDREV=Custom.1 binary-modules

	  The LIRC modules package will have a recommendation of
	  kernel-image-<kernel version> (= Custom.1)

     Note: The location of the kernel source tree may be specified by
     supplying the KSRC variable as a command line option.  For example, if
     the kernel source is located in /usr/local/src/kernel-2.0.0, the
     proper command would be
          debian/rules KSRC=/usr/local/src/kernel-2.0.0 binary-modules

by Masato Taruishi <taru@debian.org> which itself is almost an exact copy of
the documentation for the pcmcia packages made by Brian Mays <brian@debian.org>.
